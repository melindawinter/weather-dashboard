# Weather Dashboard

## Description

I have created a weather dashboard that will allow a user to get the current weather and a five day forecast for any city. They will enter the city name in the input, click the search button and the weather and forecast will be displayed. When a city is searched for, a button with its name will appear and the user can also click on this button to display the weather for that city. The weather dashboard is powered by the OpenWeather API.
